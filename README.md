🚗 U.S. EV Market Share Analysis 

📘 Project Overview

This project utilizes data provided by AnalystBuilder website to understand the growth and distribution of electric vehicles across united states. The dataset contains vehicle registration counts for multiple fuel types (EV, PHEV, HEV, gasoline, diesel, etc.) by state.I analysed vehicle registration data from all 51 states using Excel and MYSQL and visualized the key findings using Tablue.

🎯 Objectives

1. What percentage of vehicles in each state are EVs, PHEVs, HEVs, and gasoline?
2. Which states have the highest EV adoption rates, and which states lag behind?
3. Which alternative fuels (biodiesel, ethanol, hydrogen) are significant vs. niche?
4. Compare EV adoption in California vs. other large states (e.g., Texas, Florida, New York).
5. Where should policymakers prioritize EV infrastructure investment based on adoption trends and gaps in support?

🧠 Skills Demonstrated

* Data cleaning and Standardization
* Percentage calculations and aggregation
* Conditional and Comparative analysis
* Data visualization

🔍 Key Analyses

1. What percentage of vehicles in each state are EVs, PHEVs, HEVs, and gasoline?

    King Gasoline: With an average of 84% per state,gasoline vehicles maintain overwhelming market share in the United States.
    Main Alternative: Ethanol vehicles with an average of 7.6% per state Dominates the alternate market followed by HEV with an average of 2.3% per state.
    Case with EV: With an average of 0.89% per state ev's are behind.

2. Which states have the highest EV adoption rates, and which states lag behind?

    EV adoption leaders: California(3.41%),District of Columbia(2.60%),Hawaii(2.37%),Washington(2.23%),Nevada(1.85%)
    States that lag behind: North Dakota(0.13%), Mississippi(0.13%), Wyoming(0.17%), West Virginia(0.19%),South Dakota(0.19%)

3. Which alternative fuels (biodiesel, ethanol, hydrogen) are significant vs. niche?

    Hydrogen: Literally no sale in any states except for California(0.05%)
    Ethanol: Has a Meaningful presence in all states.
    Biodiesel: Presence vary between significant and niche, Has much presence in Montana(3.71%) and Wyoming(3.25%) and District of Columbia(0.13%) and Hawaii(0.31%) lag much behind

4. Compare EV adoption in California vs. other large states (e.g., Texas, Florida, New York).

    EV adoption in California is 3.41% and in other big states like Texas(0.89%),Florida(1.37%),New York(1.16%) add upto 3.42%.
  
5. Where should policymakers prioritize EV infrastructure investment based on adoption trends and gaps in support?

    In California where the EV adoption rate is 3.42% the aim should be to maintain and expand the already matured EV market.Also In other top States like District of Columbia,Hawaii and Washington where the EV       adoption rate is above 2% requires more investment to make owning EV cars reliable,convenient and more economical.Also in highly populated and density areas more convenient infrastructures should be provided
    so that people can buy EV with trust.In big cities like Florida(1.37%),Texas(0.89%),New York(1.16%) might have gap in support that's may be the reason why they are lagging behind in EV adoption rate,so            policymakers can give more focus on these cities.

💭Conclusion💭

    This Analysis of the data confirms that Gasoline still is King with an average of 84% per state, and ethanol is the main alternative(7.6%) Followed by HEV(2.3%).EV adoption is still 
    far behind with an average of only 0.89% per state.California State has the highest EV adoption 3.41% and other big states like Texas,FLorida and New York lag behind.In States like North 
    Dakota(0.13%),Mississippi(0.13%) and Wyoming(0.17) EV adoption rate is very low.More Investment,Maintenance and better government policies which encourage EV adoption in States like
    California,Texas,Florida,Washington,New York,District of Columbia,Hawaii etc can improve the EV adoption rate.
